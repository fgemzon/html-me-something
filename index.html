                    <h2>What is filipno cuisine?</h2>
                    <p>It is hard to describe filipno cuisine in one sentence, since there are 7,100 islands for this 
                    country and outside influences from past trade routes.On top of that a very complicated 
                    history of colonialism and imperialism that is reflected in the cuisine. In very gerneralizable 
                    terms the cuisine tends to rely heavily on acidity that is balanced out with other ingredients.
                    But below are some of the most popular food items from the Philippines.
